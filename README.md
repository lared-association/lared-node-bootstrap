# Key benefits üí™

-   Installable CLI tool, no repo cloning and compiling needed!
-   The configuration is parameterized via CLI commands and presets instead of by changing properties files.
-   The tool's code is unique for any type of network, new networks, or nodes in a network. It doesn't need to be copied and pasted in different projects or assemblies.
-   The config command runs on the host machine, not via docker, making it easier to debug or tune.
-   Uses the TS SDK for key generation, vrf transactions, address generation instead of using catapult-tools (nemgen is still used to generate the nemesis block).
-   Easier to maintain, the properties files are reused for all nodes, assemblies, and network types.
-   Network setup (how many databases, nodes, rest gateways to run) is defined in presets, and users can create their own ones.
-   Docker-compose yaml files are generated based on the network setup/preset instead of being manually created/upgraded.
-   The created network (config, nemesis, and docker-compose) can be zipped and distributed to other host machines for running.
-   The used docker image versions can be changed via configuration/preset.
-   Uses the [oclif](https://oclif.io) framework, new commands are easy to add and document.
-   Can be included as an npm dependency for clients' e2e testing.
## Preset üìú

Yaml files define the configuration and layout of the network and nodes, the amount of nodes, databases, rest gateways, modes, keys, etc.

Presets are defined at 3 levels from general to specific:

-   Shared: Default configurations for all the networks.
-   Network: It defines the main preset of a given network, for example: `testnet`.
-   Assembly: It defines a modification of a network, for example: `testnet peer`, `tesnet dual`, `testnet api`.

Properties in each file override the previous values (by object deep merge).

### Out-of-the-box presets:


-   `-p testnet -a peer`: A [harvesting](https://github.com/lared-association/lared-node-bootstrap/blob/main/presets/testnet/assembly-peer.yml) peer node that connects to the current public [testnet](https://github.com/lared-association/lared-node-bootstrap/blob/main/presets/testnet/network.yml). [Nemesis block](https://github.com/lared-association/lared-node-bootstrap/tree/main/presets/testnet/seed/00000) is copied over.
-   `-p testnet -a api`: An [api](https://github.com/lared-association/lared-node-bootstrap/blob/main/presets/testnet/assembly-api.yml) peer node that connects to the current public [testnet](https://github.com/lared-association/lared-node-bootstrap/blob/main/presets/testnet/network.yml) running its own mongo database and rest gateway. [Nemesis block](https://github.com/lared-association/lared-node-bootstrap/tree/main/presets/testnet/seed/00000) is copied over.
-   `-p testnet -a dual`: A [dual](https://github.com/lared-association/lared-node-bootstrap/blob/main/presets/testnet/assembly-dual.yml) harvesting peer node that connects to the current public [testnet](https://github.com/lared-association/lared-node-bootstrap/blob/main/presets/testnet/network.yml) running its own mongo database and rest gateway. [Nemesis block](https://github.com/lared-association/lared-node-bootstrap/tree/main/presets/testnet/seed/00000) is copied over.

## Target üìÅ

The folder where the generated config, docker files, and data are stored. The folder structure is:

-   `./preset.yml`: The final generated preset.yml that is used to configure bootstrap, the nodes, docker, etc.
-   `./addresses.yml`: Randomly generated data that wasn't provided in the preset, e.g.: SSL keys, nodes' keys, nemesis accounts, generation hash seed, etc.
-   `./nodes`: Contains the configuration, data, and logs for all defined node instances.
-   `./gateways`: Contains the configuration and logs for all defined node rest gateways.
-   `./nemesis`: The folder used to contain the nemesis block. Block 1 data is generated via `nemgen` tool for new networks. For an existing network, it is copied over.
-   `./databases`: The location where the mongo data is stored for  different database instances.
-   `./docker`: The generated docker-compose.yml, mongo init scripts, and server basic bash scripts. 
-   `./reports`: The location of the generated reports.

# Requirements üß∞

-   Node 10+
-   Docker
-   Docker Compose

Validate your environment by running:

```
node -v
docker -v
docker-compose -v
```

Check if your user can run docker without sudo:

```
docker run hello-world
```

If you see an error like the following:

```
Got permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket at unix:///var/run/docker.sock
```

Please follow this [guide](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/questions/how-to-fix-docker-got-permission-denied-while-trying-to-connect-to-the-docker-daemon-socket).

# Usage üñ•Ô∏è

It's recommended to run the commands from an empty working dir.

The network configuration, data, and docker files will be created inside the target folder ('./target') by default.

```
mkdir my-networks
cd my-networks
```

Once in the working dir:

<!-- usage -->
```sh-session
$ npm install -g @lared-association/lared-node-bootstrap
$ lared-node-bootstrap COMMAND
running command...
$ lared-node-bootstrap (-v|--version|version)
@lared-association/lared-node-bootstrap/0.4.2 win32-x64 node-v12.19.0
$ lared-node-bootstrap --help [COMMAND]
USAGE
  $ lared-node-bootstrap COMMAND
...
```
<!-- usagestop -->

The general usage would be:

```
lared-node-bootstrap config -p testnet -a dual
lared-node-bootstrap compose
lared-node-bootstrap run
```

If you need to start fresh, you may need to sudo remove the target folder (docker volumes dirs may be created using sudo). Example:

```
sudo rm -rf ./target
```



# Development üõ†Ô∏è

If you want to contribute to this tool, clone this repo and run:

```
npm install -g
```

Then, `lared-node-bootstrap` runs from the source code. You can now test your features after changing the code.

Pull Requests are appreciated! Please follow the contributing [guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Note: cloning this repo is intended only for people who want to tune the tool in a way it cannot otherwise be configured. In that case, please provide a feature request.
General users should install this tool like any other node module.

# Commands ‚å®Ô∏è

* [`lared-node-bootstrap clean`](docs/clean.md) - Removes the target folder, deleting the generated configuration and data.
* [`lared-node-bootstrap compose`](docs/compose.md) - Generates the `docker-compose.yml` file from the configured network.
* [`lared-node-bootstrap config`](docs/config.md) - Command used to set up the configuration files and the nemesis block for the current network.
* [`lared-node-bootstrap enrolSupernode`](docs/enrolSupernode.md) - Enrols the nodes in the supernode rewards program by announcing the enrol transaction to the registration address.
* [`lared-node-bootstrap healthCheck`](docs/healthCheck.md) - Checks if the services created with docker compose are up and running.
* [`lared-node-bootstrap help`](docs/help.md) - Displays help for lared-node-bootstrap.
* [`lared-node-bootstrap link`](docs/link.md) - Announces VRF and Voting Link transactions to the network for each node with 'Peer' or 'Voting' roles. This command finalizes the node registration to an existing network.
* [`lared-node-bootstrap report`](docs/report.md) - Generates reStructuredText (.rst) reports describing the configuration of each node.
* [`lared-node-bootstrap resetData`](docs/resetData.md) - Removes the data containing the generated configuration, certificates, keys and block 1.
* [`lared-node-bootstrap run`](docs/run.md) - Boots the network via docker using the generated `docker-compose.yml` file and configuration. The config and compose methods/commands need to be called before this method. This is just a wrapper for the `docker-compose up` bash call.
* [`lared-node-bootstrap start`](docs/start.md) - Single command that aggregates config, compose and run in one line.
* [`lared-node-bootstrap stop`](docs/stop.md) - Stops the docker-compose network if running (lared-node-bootstrap started with --detached). This is just a wrapper for the `docker-compose down` bash call.
